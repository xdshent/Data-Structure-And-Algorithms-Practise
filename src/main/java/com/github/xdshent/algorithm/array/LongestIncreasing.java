/**
 * Longest Increasing Sub Sequence
 * The longest increasing sub sequence problem is to
 * find a sub sequence of a given sequence in which
 * the sub sequence's elements are stored order,
 * lowest to highest, and in which the sub sequence is
 * as long as problem. This sub sequence is not
 * necessarily contiguous, or unique.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * consider sub sequence {0,8,4,12,2,10,6,14,1,9,5,13,3,11,7,15}
 * The longest increasing sub sequence is{0,2,6,9,11,15}
 * <p>
 * This sub sequence has length 6; the input sequence has no 7-member
 * increasing sub sequence. The longest increasing sub sequence in this
 * example is not unique: for instance,
 * {0,4,6,9,11,15} or
 * {0,4,6,9,13,15}
 * are other increasing sub sequence of equal length in the same input
 * sequence.
